# Can you make me more productive with a C++ IDE?

Writing code at the speed of thought and having the IDE take care of all mundane development tasks – that’s what productivity means for us at JetBrains. But is it even possible for a tricky language like C++? In this talk we’ll explore CLion, a cross-platform IDE for C and C++ development.

Come and learn how to save your time and generate tons of code in one click, move members up/down the hierarchy, or change the signature of a function safely. Find out how to catch and fix errors by performing static code analysis on your C/C++ code base, which identifies unused and unreachable code, runs type checks and performs data flow analysis. Check out the benefits of integrated Google Test, Catch, and various Version Control Systems.

Finally, we’ll overview the plugin repository to see what goodies it offers to CLion users.
