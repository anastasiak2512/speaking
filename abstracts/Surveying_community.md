# Surveying the community – what could possibly go wrong

As Jens Weller mentioned in his talk, we at JetBrains were the first to provide extensive research via a survey about the C++ community. Developer Ecosystem research is conducted yearly, with the infographics and the raw data published for free for everyone. Since launch we learnt many insights on how to collect and process the data to get the results which are not presenting our thoughts on state of the art but close to the real world. The knowledge starts from the way to ask questions and goes to the way we interpret the answers, including the “facepalm” issues we meet yearly. With others following our research initiative, we started an obligatory step of the yearly validation of the data we collect against the community surveys like C++ Foundation Lite. Join this lightning talk to learn from our experience what could (and will) go wrong when you start surveying the community.
