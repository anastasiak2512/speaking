# Surveying the community – what could possibly go wrong

## Option 1 (old):
We at JetBrains were the first to provide extensive research via a survey about the C++ community. Developer Ecosystem research is conducted yearly, with the infographics and the raw data published for free for everyone. Since launch we learnt many insights on how to collect and process the data to get the results which are not presenting our thoughts on state of the art but close to the real world. The knowledge starts from the way to ask questions and goes to the way we interpret the answers, including the “facepalm” issues we meet yearly. With others following our research initiative, we started an obligatory step of the yearly validation of the data we collect against the community surveys like C++ Foundation Lite. Join this talk to learn from our experience what could (and will) go wrong when you start surveying the community.

The talk will present some of the results from Developer Ecosystem 2021 research (C++ part) and how they correlate (or don't) with C++ Foundation Lite 2021 results. We'll also dive into the survey methodology aspects, learning how to remove brand, targeting and sampling biases, as well as see how a "properly" asked question changes the data in our C++ reality. 

## Option 2 (short):
We at JetBrains were the first to provide extensive research via a survey about the C++ community. Since launch, we learned many insights, starting from the way to ask questions and to the way interpret the answers, including the “facepalm” issues. Join this lightning talk to learn from our experience what could (and will) go wrong when you start surveying the community. 

## Option 3 (full talk):
There are 3 major researches in C++ community nowadays. Developer Ecosystem research by JetBrains is conducted yearly, with the infographics and the raw data published for free for everyone. Since launch we learnt many insights on how to collect and process the data to get the results which are not presenting our thoughts on state of the art but close to the real world. The knowledge starts from the way to ask questions and goes to the way we interpret the answers, including the “facepalm” issues we meet yearly.

In this talk, I'll feature the results of the recent C++ community surveys, make some comparisons, and will try to showcase how to treat the differences. We'll also dive into the survey methodology aspects, learning how to remove brand, targeting and sampling biases, as well as see how a "properly" asked question changes the data in our C++ reality. This knowledge is crucial for everyone who rely on such researches and want to use them in a correct way. Come and learn how the magic numbers are collected and how to apply them to your decisions!
