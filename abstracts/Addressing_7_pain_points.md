# How To Address 7 Major C++ Pain Points with Tools

In the Annual C++ Developer Survey conducted by the C++ Foundation, the community identified a number of major pain points when working with C++. Year-to-year leaders are the same: libraries management, build times, setting a CI pipeline, and project models. Language challenges are also coming to the top regularly, but the lack of tools in the C++ ecosystem is obvious.

Let’s see if and how the modern C++ tooling can address the things that frustrate C++ developers the most. We’ll cover things from package management, CI setups, and development environments, to CMake debug and profiling, and a bit of data flow analysis (DFA) to statically identify many sources of undefined behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
