# C++ Painkillers: The Evolution of C++ Toolability

The C++ language is among the most powerful yet challenging programming languages in the world. You see it every day in everything around you. From embedded devices to operating systems, and from trading robots to telecommunication devices and protocols, it sets the stage for all other software and tasks. The importance of systems created with C++ and the requirements set for it put immense pressure on C++ developers.

How well do we treat C++ developers? Do they have a safe and easy environment where they can focus on their core tasks? In the Annual C++ Developer Survey Lite conducted by the C++ Foundation, the community identified a number of major pain points when working with C++. The top five pain points for C++ developers have nothing to do with the language itself, but instead focus on: 

1) Managing dependencies.
2) Setting up CI/CD pipelines.
3) Build times.
4) Dealing with CMake.
5) Setting up toolchains and IDEs.

With the top C++ pain points being all about the tools, let’s discuss if the language has become more toolable throughout its evolution, what the state of its toolability is today, and how it’s going to change tomorrow. We’ll discuss what prevents C++ from being easily toolable, especially compared to other languages, highlight several examples where tools play a crucial role in the adoption of new language additions, and see how language creators started considering tooling along with language improvements. We’ll review a toolset addressing the top C++ pain points from the Annual C++ Developer Survey Lite and identify some tools we still wish we had.
