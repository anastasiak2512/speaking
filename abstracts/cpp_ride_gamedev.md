# A C++ Ride through the Gamedev universe

Gamedev is a lot in C++. And C++ language on its own is a mix of compatibility restrictions  and the adoption of best practices from other languages and technologies. Recent independent research studies show that C++ developers are still staying with C++11, slowly adopting any new standards. While in gamedev the situation is better than on average.

From the other side, many developers tend to avoid using unit testing frameworks and code analysis tools, and keep finding workarounds to emulate language features not yet accepted to the language standard (reflection!).

In this talk, weâ€™ll overview the C++ ecosystem sliced by the Gamedev area, align trends, and analyze the reasoning behind them. And see if there is a modern tooling in place that can help dealing with all the difficulties.
